# Cell type state-transition model

## Overview
These MATLAB files were used to perform all cell type state-transition modeling. For analysis of the RNA-seq data see the [R notebook](https://github.com/cohmathonc/CML.BC.scRNA-manuscript/blob/main/R/Rscript_CML.CP%2BBC.scRNA_paper_workspace.R).

Final parameter values are additionally supplied in the supplementary material of the manuscript.

## :::WORK IN PROGRESS:::

Coming soon: further documentation and annotation to describe the workflow to reproduce the analysis conducted in [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.14.653262v1)
