# scRNA-seq analysis and manuscript figure generation

## Overview
This directory contains all analysis code required to reporduce all findings and figures from the manuscript. The starting point only requires this code and a Seurat R object which is available from GEO (Accession: GSE296507 - RELEASE PENDING PUBLICATION) .

**Note** This repository is a work in progress. Further annotation and separate functions for producing manuscript figures are in the works. For now, the workspace notebook contains all code required to reproduce the manuscript figures, analysis, and results as well as intermediate analyses and some additional analyses not used in the manuscript. 

**Second Note** GEO upload and paper submission is in progress. Links and accession number will be updated as those become available.

## R

  Primary analysis with the code to generate all the main figures and most supplementary figures

## Supplemental analysis

  Code for remaining supplementary figures and analysis
