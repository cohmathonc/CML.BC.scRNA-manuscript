# scRNA-seq analysis and manuscript figure generation

## Overview
This directory contains all analysis code required to reporduce all findings and figures from the manuscript. The starting point only requires this code and a Seurat R object which is available from GEO (Accession: GSE296507 - RELEASE PENDING PUBLICATION) .

## üöß **Note** üöß 
Additional annotation and convenience functions are in the works. Currently, these two directory contains all code required to reproduce the scRNA-seq related manuscript figures, analysis, and results as well as intermediate analyses and some additional analyses not used in the manuscript. See [MATLAB] (https://github.com/cohmathonc/CML.BC.scRNA-manuscript/tree/main/MATLAB) for modeling code and figures.

‚è∞ GEO upload and paper submission is in progress. Links and accession number will be updated as those become available.

## R

  Primary analysis with the code to generate all the main figures and most supplementary figures

## supplemental_analysis

  Code for remaining supplementary figures and analysis
