# scRNA-seq analysis and manuscript figure generation

## Overview
This directory contains any remaining analysis code not included in [R](https://github.com/cohmathonc/CML.BC.scRNA-manuscript/tree/main/R) required to reporduce all findings and figures from the manuscript. The starting point only requires this code and a Seurat R object which is available from GEO (Accession: GSE296507 - RELEASE PENDING PUBLICATION).

:::WORK IN PROGRESS:::
  ðŸš§ Coming soon: code to generate h5ad object from GEO
